Proposal for Final Project
Ethan Clark
CS108

For my final project, I would like to build an user interface application similar to the games Battlestar
Galactica and Space Invaders, where their is a main space ship on the bottom of the screen, and the goal is 
to eliminate, by shooting, the other space ships on the top of the screen. The user will be able to see their 
score on the screen, which is determined by how many of the other space ships they eliminate during the game. 
The user will lose when one of the other space ships hits their main space ship. This application will make 
a lot of use of the canvas part of Tkinter. I will have buttons on the screen to reset, pause, and start the game.
