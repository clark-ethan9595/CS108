SpaceShip Adventures
Created by Ethan Clark (elc3)
CS108 - Final Project

This game contains a main, user-controlled spaceship on the bottom of the screen. The main spaceship appears once the
user clicks on the start button or hits the start key. Once the user does that, the main spaceship appears and the
enemy spaceships and asteroids begin to fall down the screen.
 
The goal of the game is to shoot laser beams at the enemy spaceships and avoid/dodge the asteroids. The user shoots 
laser beams by pressing the space bar and the user moves the main spaceship left and right with the left and right
arrow keys. The user gets 100 points for every time an enemy spaceship is taken down. There are six levels to this
game where each level the ships and asteroids come a little quicker. Also, the enemy ships do not shoot laser beams 
the first level, they shoot one laser beam at a random time the second level, and for levels three through six, the 
enemy ships shoot two laser beams at random times. The sixth level is infinite, so a new higher score can always be 
set every time someone plays.

If an enemy ship gets down to a certain point on the screen, the game is over. If the user gets hit by an asteroid,
the game is over. If the user gets hit by an enemy laser beam, the game is over. There are start, pause, resume, and 
restart buttons that allow the user to do the task given by the name of the button when it is clicked. There is also 
an instructions button that opens a separate window that gives the goals, instructions, and keyboard shortcuts for 
the game.
